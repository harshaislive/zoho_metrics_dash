You are supposed to build this app linking to supabase using anon key and project url. I have provided you access to MCP server of supabase so that you can take it's help to get an Idea.

We are building only two pages: Projects and Users. 

The metrics we want to use are in [sql.md](mdc:sql.md) including fetch statements and functions I made in supabase already.

Remember to build it in less complex way. 

Always examine complete codebase to see what we already have.

Analysis for Projects and Users

## I. Project Metrics (Scorecard)
Focus on task progress, timeliness, and overall delivery performance to keep it simple and actionable.

### Key Metrics:
1. **Task Completion Rate**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Completion Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Completed Tasks}}{\text{Total Number of Tasks}} \times 100
     \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** Tracks overall project progress and ensures steady momentum.

2. **Timeliness Rate**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Timeliness Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Tasks Completed on Time}}{\text{Total Number of Tasks}} \times 100
     \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** Measures adherence to deadlines and highlights delays.

3. **Open Tasks Aging**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Open Tasks Aging} = \frac{\sum \text{(Current Date - Task Creation Date)}}{\text{Number of Open Tasks}}
     \]  
     (Average number of days since open tasks were created or last updated.)  
   - **Why It Matters:** Flags stagnating tasks, providing insights into project bottlenecks.

4. **Backlog Rate**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Backlog Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Tasks Not Started}}{\text{Total Number of Tasks}} \times 100
     \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** Tracks readiness and planning gaps.

## II. User Metrics (Scorecard)
Focus on individual engagement, timeliness, and efficiency to assess user-level contributions.

### Key Metrics:
1. **Utilization Rate**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Utilization Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Tasks Updated within 1 Day}}{\text{Number of Open/In-Progress Tasks}} \times 100
     \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** Ensures users are actively managing their assigned tasks.

2. **Task Timeliness**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Task Timeliness} = \frac{\text{Number of Tasks Completed on Time}}{\text{Total Number of Assigned Tasks}} \times 100
     \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** Tracks individual adherence to deadlines.

3. **Average Completion Time**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Average Completion Time} = \frac{\sum \text{Time Spent on Completed Tasks}}{\text{Number of Completed Tasks}}
     \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** Measures individual efficiency in completing tasks.

4. **Pending Tasks Aging**  
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Pending Tasks Aging} = \frac{\sum \text{(Current Date - Last Update Date)}}{\text{Number of Pending Tasks}}
     \]  
     (Average number of days since pending tasks were last updated.)  
   - **Why It Matters:** Flags delayed or stagnating tasks.

## III. Scorecard Structure

### 1. Project Scorecard:
| Metric                  | Value | Target/Benchmark | Status               |
|-------------------------|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| Task Completion Rate (%)| 85%   | ≥ 90%            | Amber (Moderate)     |
| Timeliness Rate (%)     | 78%   | ≥ 85%            | Amber (Moderate)     |
| Open Tasks Aging (days) | 3     | ≤ 2              | Red (Needs Improvement) |
| Backlog Rate (%)        | 10%   | ≤ 5%             | Amber (Moderate)     |

### 2. User Scorecard:
| User  | Metric                  | Value | Target/Benchmark | Status               |
|-------|-------------------------|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| User A| Utilization Rate (%)    | 92%   | ≥ 90%            | Green (Good)         |
|       | Task Timeliness (%)     | 80%   | ≥ 85%            | Amber (Moderate)     |
|       | Avg Completion Time (hrs)| 6    | ≤ 5              | Amber (Moderate)     |
|       | Pending Tasks Aging (days)| 4    | ≤ 2              | Red (Needs Improvement) |

---

### Key Notes:
1. **Task Completion Rate** and **Timeliness Rate** are percentages, so they are multiplied by 100.
2. **Open Tasks Aging** and **Pending Tasks Aging** are averages, calculated by summing the days since creation/last update and dividing by the number of tasks.
3. **Average Completion Time** is calculated by dividing the total time spent on tasks by the number of completed tasks.
